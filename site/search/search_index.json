Loading a graph : Suppose we have an 'edgelist.txt' file with the following edegs: 0 1 1 2 1 3 2 4 We can define and load the graph like this: graph g { edges: file 'edgelist.txt'; }; This would tell the language to create a graph g and load its edges from the file edgelist.txt 2. Using built-in functions of the DSL: Suppose we want to find the bfs path of the graph g we previously had. In order to use the built-in function of the GraphEasy we can simply query it using : query k : 'bfs' of g; This would perform bfs on the graph g and load the path in k. If we want to print the path we can do it in the following way. print k; 3. Using for-each loop in the graph: Our language provides user to iterate the graph in a simple, intuitive manner using the for-each method. for each vertex v in g{ } 4. Using if else, while loops: Using if else and basic while loops is similar to C++ syntax. if(condition){ } else{ } and while loop is while(condition){ }","title":"Tutorial: Using the language"},{"location":"tutorial/#tutorial-using-the-language","text":"This language will let you describe graphs and load them from a simple edgelist file.","title":"Tutorial: Using the language"},{"location":"tutorial/#1-loading-a-graph","text":"Suppose we have an 'edgelist.txt' file with the following edegs: 0 1 1 2 1 3 2 4 We can define and load the graph like this: graph g { edges: file 'edgelist.txt'; }; This would tell the language to create a graph g and load its edges from the file edgelist.txt","title":"1.
